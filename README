FNK is an easy-to-learn visual programming environment based on an internal functional language.

It aims to be a "visual programming environment for audio and image processing", accessible to everyone through a browser.

It is based on my graduation project, which was originally done in Flash:

No crazy plans ahead, just something I'm doing for fun and learning.

Here's an early prototype of the editor interface:

And the language is running! You can see it here (check the source and the console output):

===============

While not formally based on it, Fnk.js reuses a lot of concepts borrowed from the Three.js project, namely the codefile structure for the source files.

The whole idea behind Fnk.js is only possible because other similar languages and platforms came first. There are plenty of those, but these are the better known ones:

Max (aka Max/MSP)
