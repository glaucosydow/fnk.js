FNK is an easy-to-learn visual programming environment based on an internal functional language.

It aims to be a "visual programming environment for audio and image processing", accessible to everyone through a browser.

It is based on my graduation project, which was originally done in Flash:

No crazy plans ahead, just something I'm doing for fun and learning.

Here's an early prototype of the editor interface:

And the language is running! You can see it here (check the source and the console output):
