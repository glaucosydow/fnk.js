CORE

* Add proper dispose() to nodes
* Implement change booleans, caches, signals?
* Nodes

  * Video
  * NodeRendererItemText: need to interpret multiple text item nodes properly
  * IO Nodes need to have a separate "input" for when the value is changed by the user
  * VisualNodes shouldn't update their visuals immediately on node changes; mark as "dirty" instead and update later?


EDITOR

  * Add save and load

* Help XMLs

* Visual Nodes
  * Draw values
  * How to decide how to draw the values?
  * When resizing, force the cursor to always be correct even when the cursor is not on top of the correct handle? (need to set the cursor of the background to match the current handle cursor)
  * When resizing, if resized to minimum height, then resized up, it resizes as relative values instead of absolute values.. looks weird

* Add process() call
* Add proper dispose() where needed
